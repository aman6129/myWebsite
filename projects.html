        A silly website made at my first hackathon (HackTX). You put in a cell-phone number
        and the person gets a randomly generated (fake) fact about cats! The backend was done
        in python with the help of the Twilio API to send text messages.

        <a  href = "http://animal-farm.herokuapp.com"> - AnimalFarm </a> <br></br>
        For my second hackathon (HackRice). It's a lightweight debate forum where you can anonymously post
        a topic and discuss it. The goal was to make something more complex than CatFacts. It's built on python
        SQLite3 and Flaskr.

        A project for my programming studios class, the assignment was to make a networked multiplayer 
        HTML5 game. I wrote almost all the code for the game and did around half of the art assets. Right now 
        this links to a video of the game, currently working on hosting it somewhere.

        <a href = "index.html"> - My Website </a> <br></br>
        Website I made sort of like an online portfolia. Pretty proud of it. The splash screen text fadein/out was
        made with some javascript. I plan on hosting it on my own domain soon.
