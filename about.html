        I'm a junior at Texas A&M University studying Computer Science; should be graduating
        May 2016. I like programming (obviously), rock climbing, mountain biking, skateboarding, art, music, and all sorts of other stuff.
        <br> </br>
        If you want to see my code go check out my <a href = "https://github.com/aman6129"> github.</a> Anything big that I've made
        or projects I'm especially proud of, their source code can be found there.
